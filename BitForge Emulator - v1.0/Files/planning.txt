Operand 1 (mi, mr):
- ws{BITS}b.{OPERAND_1}
- r is set by the mval move size; for mvalplus it is always 64

Operand 2 (i, mi, mr):
- ws{BITS}b.{OPERAND_2}
- r is set by the mval move size; for mvalplus it is always 64

Operand 1 (mi, mr) again:
- rb{BITS}b.{OPERAND_1}
- r is set by mval move size; for mvalplus it is always 64

MVAL8–64:
- Operand 2 can be any size; if >64 bits use mvalplus
- Cropping: moving bigger value to smaller space removes high bytes (from start)
- Zero-extension: moving smaller value to bigger space pads with zeros
- No custom sizes; use mvalplus for that

mvalplus:
- Operand 2 can be any size
- Cropping: bigger → smaller removes high bytes
- Zero-extension: smaller → bigger pads with zeros
- Slower but flexible

RULE:
- For mval8–mval64, no operand can exceed 64 bits

ERRORS:
- Can disable errors like: @err throw widthSpecifierTooSmallForImmediate false
