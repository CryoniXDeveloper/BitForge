mval8 operates strictly on 8-bit data.

When the destination is a register
→ Only the lower 8 bits of that register are written.
→ Values larger than 8 bits are NOT allowed.

When the source is an immediate
→ The immediate must fit in 8 bits (0x00–0xFF).
→ Any larger value results in an error.

When using direct memory addressing
→ The address itself may be up to 64 bits.
→ Exactly 8 bits are read from that memory location.

When using indirect memory addressing
→ The full 64-bit register is used as the address.
→ Exactly 8 bits are read from the computed address.
